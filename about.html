        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm an experienced IT professional with a strong background in computer science and data analytics. I hold both a master's and bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of East London, where I developed a deep understanding of programming, machine learning, and data analysis. My final year project on weather prediction allowed me to gain hands-on experience with Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Over the years, I've honed my skills in various technical roles. Currently, I am a Data Analyst at Gandhi Oriental Foods Ltd., where I specialize in data manipulation, statistical analysis, database management, and creating compelling data visualizations using tools like Power BI. My work here has strengthened my analytical skills and taught me the importance of presenting data in a clear and actionable manner.

Prior to this role, I accumulated five years of experience as a Network Engineer, which enriched my understanding of complex network systems and troubleshooting. I have also had the opportunity to gain software engineering experience at 1SW Events Ltd., where I contributed to developing software solutions.

I am passionate about continuous learning and have a keen interest in cloud services, particularly in AWS technologies like S3, Lambda, Event Bridge, QuickSight, CloudWatch, and SQS. My goal is to leverage these skills to create scalable and efficient solutions.

When I'm not working on tech projects, I enjoy exploring new trends in technology, contributing to collaborative projects, and expanding my expertise to keep up with the fast-paced industry.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me!</p>
